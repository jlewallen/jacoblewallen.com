Hey there! I'm currently in the process of migrating this blog from an
old WordPress install and so, there's a ton of old posts up on here
for now. I'm definitely hoping to start writing more and also include
high level pages on projects I'm involved with.

A longer version is that I'm finally taking the new year to lesson my
dependence on existing social media sites like Twitter and especially
Facebook. I've been wanting to bring back my personal website for
several months. I've seen a few online personalities express that 2020
would be the year of the personal website and I think there's
something to that. This is just one step towards taking control of my
data and content and insulating myself the perils that we've gotten
with existing social media.

If any of your interests overlap with mine, stay tuned!
