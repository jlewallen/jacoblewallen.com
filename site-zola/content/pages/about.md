Hey there! My name is Jacob. I love programming, woodworking, nature (birds,
trees, etc...), stained glass, cooking, reading, music and people.

I'm on a multi-year journey to find a way to use this space in a way that I
enjoy and constently brings me back, let alone others. I'm writing this on
11/9/2022 and it's pretty safe to say you're in the future so if it's
unimpressive in 2023 I can assure you something else came up. November of 2022
is an interesting time for those of us that are Online, I dunno if you
remember.

Anyway, thanks for showing up and poking around. Drop me a message on Mastodon,
if you wanna.
